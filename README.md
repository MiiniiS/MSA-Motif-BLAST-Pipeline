# MSA-Motif-BLAST-Pipeline
A comprehensive bioinformatics workflow for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), motif discovery, and organism identification using BLAST.
#🔬 Overview
This project performs:
1.Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
2.Motif Searching (Regex or MEME Suite optional)
3.BLAST-based Organism Identification
The goal is to help researchers analyze sequence patterns, find conserved elements, and classify unknown sequences.

#✨ Features
1.MSA using MUSCLE or MAFFT
2.Motif detection using regular expressions
3.BLAST search using BLAST+ tools
4.Reproducible, modular Python scripts
5.Organized output folders
